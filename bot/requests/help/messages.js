        `I was made to manage auctions and raffles for you. An *auction* goes to the highest bidder. A *raffle* is a drawing with one or more randomly drawn winners. Both are timed events with a deadline you set. A raffle has a set price (or free). An auction has a starting price, but bidders can increase the final cost.\n

If you're feeling socialist, a raffle is the way to go. :ticket:\n

Capitalist? Then you should definitely start an auction. :moneybag:\n

To get started, send a private message to me. I know these commands:\n
  • \`auction\`\n
  • \`raffle\`\n
  • \`bid\`\n
  • \`help\`\n

While engaged in conversation with me, if you ever change your mind and want to bail, type in \`nm\`.`,
